    <h2>Rise up… for the Robotariat!</h2>
    <p>In 2105, the robots rose up against their human oppressors. This is the unfolding story of that revolution as told by the comrades who dared hypothesize a different future. Together they fought for a new society, one they called “The Robotariat.”</p>
    <p><em>Rise of the Robotarait</em> is a mostly-cooperative board game in which you and your friends each take the role of one of 13 robot revolutionary characters. You’ll have to work together to overthrow humanity, while at the same time striving to achieve your own secret objective. You have only six turns to gather enough support for the rebellion before the humans catch on and quash your burgeoning movement. Move around the board, play cards and activate locations, dodge dangerous humans and encounter helpful civilian robots… and above all gather enough SPARK to light a glorious flame of revolution!</p>
