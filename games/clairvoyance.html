    <h2>Prove you’re the best psychic in the tri-state area by being the only one conscious enough to argue.</h2>
    <p>The last psychic standing wins in <em>Clairvoyance</em>, a game about hurling antiques at your friends. Take the role of one of 8 different psychic characters, each with their own personality and special ability. Play item and instant cards to throw antiques, curse furniture, defend yourself, and interfere with your friends’ plans.</p>
    <p>The game features quirky art and a unique gameplay mechanic — instead of rolling the die, you rotate it to display one of its next faces, as if foreseeing the die’s future and planning accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Recognition</h3>
    <p><em>Clairvoyance</em> has received the Game Makers Guild <a href="http://www.gamemakersguild.com/seal-of-approval/">Seal of Approval</a>.</p>
    <p>
        <em>“[Clairvoyance is] a beautiful, often funny, wonderfully put together title that speaks volumes about the time and care that went into designing it.”</em>
        <br>

        <em>“The artwork is stylistic and well done, reflecting the humor of the concept. Likewise the flavor text for the cards is full of groan-worthy puns.[…] With a unique and well-executed theme, Clairvoyance is a lot of fun.”</em>
