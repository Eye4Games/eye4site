    <h2>Become the pizza (delivery) champion in an ever-changing city.</h2>
    <p><em>Pizza City</em> is a game for ideally 4 players in two teams of two. On each team players are either a Pizza Courier, trying to navigate the streets of Pizza City on bikes to deliver pizzas, or a City Planner who’s constantly changing the landscape of the city to help their teammate and hinder their opponent.</p>
    <p>Each one of their turns the City Planner or “City Player” lays down two city cards a turn which add (or cover up) either buildings or parks to the city, block by block, along with features like stop signs, one ways, and subway stations.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile the Pizza Courier or “Bike Player” plays or banks two movement and flair cards to try and move around the city. Their flair cards allow them to avoid obstacles, take shortcuts through buildings, or even ride the subway.</p>
    <p>The first team to successfully deliver three pizzas and claim three drop-off tokens is crowned the pizza champions.</p>
