    <h2>Bluff your way to victory, or at least the next hand.</h2>
    <p>Travelers in the dangerous Weird West play a poker-like game in the local taverns. Aim for the winning hand by swapping cards, peeking at hands, and pulling an ace from your sleeve.</p>
    <p><em>Bluff the Bullet</em> is a poker-like game, with extra elements of bluffing and special card abilities. Players are dealt a “Poker Hand” that determines if they win or lose, and “Action Cards,” whose cards have abilities that they can use to help improve their Poker Hands.</p>
    <p>At the start of the game, players are dealt a five-card Poker Hand, and are competing to have the best hand at the end of each round. But everyone at the table is a no-good cheater trying to change the cards on the table.</p>
    <p>They accomplish this cheating using their Action Cards. During the game they will use abilities on these Action Cards to learn about and change both their and others’ Poker Hands, to try to give themselves the best Poker Hand possible.</p>
