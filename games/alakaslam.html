    <h2>The court hums with ancient magick…</h2>
    <p><em>AlakaSLAM</em> is a 2 to 4 player card game: a tennis match, spiced up with magic, and folded up into one small box.</p>
    <p>Players manage hands of cards, deciding whether to strike aggressively or cautiously build up resources, and taking care because each card has two purposes. Cards can be used to aim and hit the ball — maneuvering opponents into tricky spots — or used to give players extra movement around the court and enchant shots, making them difficult for rivals to return.</p>
    <p>Face off against rival sorcerers and become a legend in the greatest tennis match of all… <em>the AlakaSLAM!</em></p>

        <em>“AlakaSLAM is a good game that accomplishes what it set out to do with aplomb. It would be a great addition to your con bag or played as a pick up while waiting for the rest of your game group to show up for Arkham Horror.”</em>

        <em>“Alakaslam is a bit spartan on theme, but it makes up for that by providing just enough decision-making where you walk away appreciating what it’s trying to do.”</em>
