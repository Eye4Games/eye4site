# Aloft Rules

<time>Updated 05.15.2017</time>

> You were born, grew up, and live in the sky. If you are lucky, you’ll become a legend in it, too.
>
> Humanity has long since left the earth, and if anything still exists below the gray and white cloud masses swirling beneath you, no one remembers. The people’s heads instead are filled with tales of adventurers who soar the far-flung corners of their new home. As a young sky commodore, you’ll make it your destiny to build the greatest fleet the sky has every known and dazzle your way into the people’s hearts.
> 
> To succeed, you’ll need to explore unchartered skies and gather resources from clever merchant trades, skirmishes with leviathans, foraging on mountain tops, or stealing straight out of your competition’s ships. With this, you’ll make a fleet so magnificent that the storytellers write your name among the stars.

### Goal and Game End
You are competing to be the first player to complete three goals. Once a player has done so, the game ends immediately, and that player wins.

When on your turn you meet the requirements for an goal, place a goal token in your color on the Goal card to indicate this. You may not complete the same goal twice.

## Set-up
### Game Set-up
1. Place a merchant hex in the center of the table.
2. Place the following resource hexes in clockwise order along the edges of the merchant hex: canvas, wood, dragon’s breath, glass, wood, and dragon’s breath.
3. Gather the number tokens 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and place one faceup on top of each of the revealed resource hexes.
4. Remove 2 random leviathan hexes from the game.
5. Turn the remaining hexes (resource, leviathan, and merchant) facedown, shuffle them together, and place them facedown in a stack.
6. Shuffle the number tokens and place them facedown in a stack.
7. Shuffle the Goal cards and randomly select 5 to use. Place the 5 faceup in reach of all players. Remove the remaining Goals from the game.
8. If the Goal card reading “Completed if: You have at least 3 ships, and all of your ships are adjacent to a number (ex. 4) randomly chosen at the start of the game,” is among the 5 in play, determine that number now by selecting the top number token off the stack.
9. Sort the Shipyard deck into stacks of each type. Randomly select 5 ship types to use and place their stacks faceup in reach of all players. Remove the remaining Shipyard cards from the game.

### Player Set-up
1. Each player choses a color and takes the Captaining cards and standees in that color.
2. Each player takes the 3 goal tokens in their color.
3. Each player takes a Starter ship card and Starter ship token and slots the ship token into a standee in their color.
4. Each player takes a resource tracker in their color and one of each resource token. Stack all the tokens on the zero space. As players gain more of one type of resource or spend that resource, they move the corresponding token up and down the tracker accordingly.
5. The first player is whoever’s feet were off the ground last.
6. Play proceeds clockwise.
7. Starting with the first player, each player places their Starter ship on one corner of the merchant hex. No two ships may occupy the same corner.
8. Each player gains their choice of 1 non-metal resource token.

## Understanding your ships
### Indicators
On the board, ships are represented by ship tokens slotted into standees. When a player builds a ship, they take the associated ship card and slot the relevant ship token into a standee in their color. Then they select their Captaining card with a number matching that of the standee and slide it underneath the ship card.

In in this way, it indicates which ship is represented by which token-standee combo, which helps differentiate in cases where a player owns multiple of the same type of ship. Some players find it helpful to use Captaining cards with all of their ship cards for quicker reference and identification.

### Stats
A ship’s stats are listed on the associated ship card.

#### Move
Each ship can move up to the number of spaces equal to its movement. You may chose not to move a ship.

Ships move between hex corners. One space of movement lets a ship travel from one corner to an adjacent corner.

Ships may move through each other. Ships cannot occupy the same corner. If it is impossible to move one of your ships due to its position, you may choose to move it to the nearest open space.

#### Forage
Your ship’s forage value is its ability to collect resources.

The higher a ship’s forage value, the more resources it collects from an adjacent hex when that hex’s number is called during the Forage phase of the turn. For example, if a ship’s forage value is 1 and it touches two #3 hexes, it will collect one resource from each of those hexes when the number 3 is called. If the ship’s forage value is 0, it won’t collect any resources.

#### Plunder
*Others’ ships:* Your ship’s plunder value is the number of resources it takes when plundering another ship. You must be adjacent to a ship to plunder it.

*Leviathans:* Leviathans are giant beasts whose scales or other aspects may be harvested as valuable resources. Your ship’s plunder value determines how many times you take the reward resources listed on the leviathan hex when plundering a leviathan. You also inflict damage on the leviathan equal to your plunder value.

## Understanding Leviathans
All leviathans start with 4 health.

Any time you attack a leviathan, you take 2 of the specified resource for each unit of plunder your attacking ship has.

A leviathan hex cannot be terraformed until the leviathan reaches 0 health. When you terraform a leviathan hex, shuffle it back into the hex stack.

A leviathan with 0 health cannot be plundered from.

## The Turn

The Turn consists of a Forage phase followed by Ship Actions phase.

### Forage
Announce your choice of a number 1 through 6.

All players check if they have any ships adjacent to a hex marked with that number token.

* If they do, they collect resources from those hexes equal to their adjacent ships’ forage values. They take the relevant resource tokens from the supply.
* Your resources are considered to all be stored in one personal pool, regardless of which of your ships actually collected them.

### Ship Actions
One at a time, your ships act. Make all the action choices for one ship before moving to the next ship.

#### Actions
During its action phase, your ship may perform as many of the following actions as you wish, in any order. The ship must finish with one action before moving on to the next and may not then revisit an action it has already taken this turn.

* Move
* Explore
* Upgrade
* Build ships
* Plunder
* Trade

##### Move
Move the ship a number of spaces up to its movement value. See “Understanding your ships” for more detail.

##### Explore/Terraform

Pay 1 resource to explore or re-explore an area adjacent to your ship. (Paid resources go back to the supply.) You may take these actions multiple times.

Choose either of the following:

*Explore:*
* Reveal the top hex off the stack and place it into an empty space adjacent to your ship.
* When a new resource hex is placed, a new number token is drawn and placed on that hex.
* If you draw a leviathan hex during exploration, receive 1 of the reward resources listed on that hex.
  * Leviathans start with 4 health. To keep track of its health, place a six-sided die by the leviathan hex, displaying the 4 faceup.

*Terraform a resource hex:* Take a resource hex adjacent to your ship and remove it and its number token from the game. Then add a new hex as if you were exploring.

You may not terraform a resource hex if you already explored or terraformed it with any of your ships this turn.

Terraform a leviathan hex: If your ship is adjacent to a leviathan at 0 health, you may remove it from the board and shuffle the hex back into the hexes stack. Then add a new hex as if you were exploring.

##### Upgrade (once per ship)
You may only upgrade each ship once per turn. No one may upgrade a ship unless a player has built a ship that game.

* Pay the cost listed on your ship card  to make that upgrade.
* Place an upgrade token on the card to indicate you have it.

*Note: You may not give your ship an upgrade for which it already it has a token.*

##### Build ships
A ship with the Build ability can build one ship per Ship Actions phase, so long as you have the appropriate resources

Ships displayed in the Shipyard are available to be built. You may only build one Basic ship per game.

To build a ship, spend the resources stated on the ship card.

When you build a ship, take its card from the Shipyard or Basic stack.

* Slide one of your Captaining cards under the ship card. Place the associated ship token in the standee with the same number as the Captaining card.
* Place the newly created ship onto an empty hex corner adjacent to the ship that built it. *Note: If all adjacent corners are occupied, you may not build.*

A ship cannot move or take an action on the turn it was built.

##### Plunder (once per ship)
Each ship may plunder only once per turn. You may plunder other players’ ships or leviathans.

You must be adjacent to a ship or leviathan to plunder it.

*If you plunder a player:* Take an amount of resources from that player’s personal pool up to your plunder value. You choose which resources.

*If you plunder a leviathan:*
* Take the relevant reward. The leviathan hex lists resource rewards associated with your ship’s plunder value.
* You also deal damage to the leviathan equal to your plunder value. Turn the leviathan’s health die to show how much health remains after your attack.

##### Trade
If your ship is adjacent to a merchant tile, you may trade 2 of the same resource type from your collection for 1 resource of your choice.
