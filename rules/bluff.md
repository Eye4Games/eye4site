# Bluff the Bullet Rules

<time>Updated 7.17.2022</time>

> Travelers in the dangerous Weird West play a poker-like game in the local taverns. Aim for the winning hand by swapping cards, peeking at hands, and pulling an ace from your sleeve.

## Components
* 56 card deck (two copies of each number card)
* 5 Reference cards
* These rules

## Overview

*Bluff the Bullet* is a poker-like game, with extra elements of bluffing and special card abilities. Players are dealt a “Poker Hand” that determines if they win or lose, and “Action Cards,” whose cards have abilities that they can use to help improve their Poker Hands.

At the start of the game, players are dealt a five-card Poker Hand, and are competing to have the best hand at the end of each round. But everyone at the table is a no-good cheater trying to change the cards on the table.

They accomplish this cheating using their Action Cards. During the game they will use abilities on these Action Cards to learn about and change both their and others’ Poker Hands, to try to give themselves the best Poker Hand possible.

Poker Hands are ranked similarly (but not exactly) like actual poker. See “Scoring” for details.

## Setup
1. Set the “Fin” card aside from the rest of the deck
2. Prepare the deck depending on the number of players
   * | # players | values incuded |
    | --- | --- |
    | 2 | 1–4 |
    | 3 | 1–5 |
    | 4 | 1–6 |
    | 5 | 1–7 |
   * Take 10 random cards and the “Fin” card. Shuffle them all together.
   * Shuffle the rest of the cards, separately
   * Place the 11 card section (with the “Fin” card in it) underneath the rest of the deck.

3. Deal each player a Poker Hand consisting of:
   * 3 face-up cards
   *  2 face-down cards. Each player may look at their own facedown cards at any time during the game.
   *  Deal each player a single card for their initial Action Cards.
4. Determine the starting player.
   * The starting player is the person with the best visible hand (look at only their 3 face-up cards).
   * In the event of a tie, whoever is closest to the dealer’s left is the first player.

## Cards
Each card has a suit and number value from 1 to 7 (or less if playing with fewer players). The number values are important for scoring.

Each card also has an ability based on its suit. When you use an ability, state which card(s) its ability is targeting. All abilities except for bullets affect Poker Hand cards.

### Suit Abilities
#### Crow
*Discard* any one Poker Hand card from any player. Replace it with this card face-up.

#### Cup
*Swap* any one Poker Hand card for any other Poker Hand card.

#### Key
*Look* at all of one player’s Poker Hand cards.

#### Bullet
*Cancel* the ability of one card that was just played.

## Playing the Round
Beginning with the starting player and proceeding in clockwise order, each player takes a turn drawing until they have two cards and then taking a single action from their Action Cards.

### Drawing Cards
At the start of your turn, draw cards until you have two Action Cards.

### Playing a Card
* When you play a card, place it facedown on the table and state aloud which of the four possible abilities you are activating, and which cards it will affect. 
  * You do not have to be honest — you may bluff and state an ability that is not on your card.
* Other players have a chance to respond by calling your bluff or playing a bullet. If they do not do so, carry out your stated action.
* After your action happens, discard the played card face-up. Other players will now know whether you had been bluffing or not. Gloat as appropriate.

#### Calling a Bluff
When another player plays a card, you have the opportunity to call them out if you think they’re bluffing. If you call a bluff on someone, they reveal their played card, flipping it faceup.

If the card does not show the ability that they stated they were using, they have been caught bluffing. Their played card has no effect, and at the end of their turn, the bluffing player must discard one card from their Poker Hand and replace it with the top card of the deck face-down. The player who called their bluff chooses which card from their Poker Hand to discard.

If the card does show the stated ability, you have erred. The played card takes its effect, and at the end of the turn, the player you accused of bluffing selects one of your Scoring Cards, you must discard this card and replace it with the top card of the deck face-down.

In either situation, if the card that replaces the Poker Hand card is the “End of Game” card, replace it with the next top card of the deck, and then the game immediately ends.

#### Bullets
Bullet cards are played from your Action Cards, and may be used out of turn to cancel the effect of the card ability a player is trying to use.

The bullet card is still played facedown, and only 1 bullet can be played on a targeted card.

Once a bullet has been played on a card, no one can call a bluff on that targeted card. Instead, they may call a bluff on the bullet card. If this happens, resolve it according to the “Calling a bluff” rules above.

It is possible to play a bullet card on another player’s bullet card. If successful, this second bullet will cancel the first, and the original card will activate normally.

## End of game
When a player draws the “Fin” card, the game immediately ends. If the “Fin” card replaces a card in a Poker Hand due to someone calling a bluff, replace the “Fin” card with the next card of the deck, shuffling as needed. Then the game immediately ends. All players reveal their Poker Hand and whoever has the strongest Poker Hand is the winner.

## Scoring
### Poker Hand Rank
Poker Hands are ranked based on the number values of the cards. Cards’ suits are not relevant to scoring. Poker Hands are ranked below (each hand beats any hand listed below it):

1. Five-of-a-Kind: Five cards, all of the same number. <br> *Ex. five 1s*
2. Four-of-a-Kind
3. Full House: three-of-a-kind and two-of-a-kind. <br> *Ex. three 1’s and two 5’s*
4. Three-of-a-Kind
5. Two Pair: two-of-a-kind and two-of-a-kind. <br>*Ex. two 2s and two 5s*
6. Pair: Two-of-a-kind.
7. High Card: The highest value card in your hand.

### Tie-Breakers
If there are two hands of the same ranking, the tie is broken as follows.

Look at the value of the number card that appears most frequently in a tied player’s hand. Compare it to the value of the most frequently-appearing number card in the other tied player(s)’ hand(s). The hand with the higher number wins. (Ex. A Four-of-a-Kind with four 3’s beats a Four-of-a-Kind with four 2’s).

If both players’ most frequently-appearing cards have the same value, compare the values of the next most frequent card and so on. (Ex. a Full House with a set of three 6’s would beat a Full House with a set of three 4’s. A Full House with a set of three 6’s and two 5’s would beat a Full House with a set of three 6’s and two 3’s).

In cases where there is not a most frequent card, the highest card value wins. (Ex. For tied Five-Card Straight, the winner is the player who’s straight ends in the highest value card. A straight of 2,3,4,5,6 beats a straight of 1,2,3,4,5).
