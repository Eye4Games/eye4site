            <blockquote>
                <p>Power Up!</p>
                <p>Defense Force Ultra Squad, a team of teens with extraordinary powers, is all that stands between the people of Phoenix Bluff &mdash; nay, all of Earth! &mdash; and terror at the hands of villainous masterminds and fearsome monsters.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><em>Defense Force Ultra</em> is a co-operative drafting game for 3&ndash;5 players.</p>
            <p>Play as Ultra Squad scout members and work together to take down villains and keep the world safe. Bring the villain to zero health before they can do the same to you and your teammates!</p>
            <p>Draft cards to prepare actions then use them to fight against a villain deck, heal teammates, and boost each other’s moves.</p>
            <h3>Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Villain decks</li>
                <li>Villain tracks</li>
                <li>Hero deck (lone hero cards and team hero cards)
                <ul>
                    <li>There are 12 copies of each lone hero card</li>
                    <li>There are 6 copies of each team hero card</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Health and villain track markers</li>
                <li>48 attack boost tokens</li>
                <li>16 attack reduction tokens</li>
                <li>32 defense boost tokens</li>
                <li>5 reference cards</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Goal and Game End</h3>
            <p>You win by bringing the villain to zero health. You lose if any player hits zero health.</p>
            <p>Players start with 15 health. They cannot gain more than 15 health.</p>
           
            <h3>Set-up</h3>
            <h4>Choose the Decks</h4>
            <p>Select 6 types of lone hero cards. Select 2 types of team hero cards. Shuffle all of these cards together to create the Hero deck.</p>
            <p>Each player selects a Hero to use. Each hero has a special ability that can be activated once per round. Give each player a health marker, set to 15.</p>
            <p>Select a villain deck to use. Set the villain deck where everyone can see it. Place the associated villain track(s) and a track marker by the villain deck.</p>
            <p>On the very first round of the game, the villain takes their setup turn. Read the villain&rsquo;s character card to learn how to conduct this turn and set up any tracks.</p>
            
            <h2>Round Order</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Villain</li>
                <li>Deal</li>
                <li>Draft and Fight</li>
                <li>Back into the Fray!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Villain</h3>
            <p>The Villain schemes and/or attacks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The villain conducts their turn, as described on the Villain card. (Typically this involves flipping over the top card of the deck).
                <ul>
                    <li>This may involve activating revealed cards. The Villain card indicates when in the Villain turn this occurs.</li>
                    <li>If multiple Villain cards would activate simultaneously, the players choose which occurs first.</li>
                    <li>If there are multiple options for targets of a Villain effect, the players choose which of the options are targeted.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Deal</h3>
            <p>Deal each player 7 cards face-down from the Hero deck.</p>
            
            <h3>Draft and Fight</h3>
            <p>Players select cards through a draft to give them actions to use. When a player has collected enough of copies of an action card to create a set (see &ldquo;Explaining Sets&rdquo; section, below), the action described on the card is activated.</p>
            
            <h4>Select</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All players simultaneously look at their hands. Each selects one card to keep and places it face-down in front of them.
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may not tell anyone what card you are placing face-down or what cards are in your hand.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When everyone is ready, players simultaneously reveal their face-down card and/or enact a player ability which affects their drafted card.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Activate</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player has an opportunity to use any non-draft abilities.</li>
                <li>Then, if any team hero sets are completed, they activate (if multiple sets, the players choose the order) and then discard the cards used. (See &ldquo;Explaining Sets&rdquo;)</li>
                <li>Next, if a revealed lone hero card completes a set, that set activates and then discards. (See &ldquo;Explaining Sets&rdquo;)
                    <ul>
                        <li>If multiple lone hero sets are completed at this point, they all use the combo effect, but the players choose the order in which to resolve the effects.</li>
                        <li>If there is only one lone hero set completed at this point, it is considered a solo activation and uses the solo effect.</li>
                        <li>Some sets might make other sets complete as part of their activation. If this is the case, start another Activate step after this Activate step completes for the new sets. The new sets do not combo with the previous Activate step.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once all sets that were created have been activated, continue to the Pass step.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Pass</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All players pass their remaining hands to the player to the left of them.
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may not look at other players&rsquo; hands or ask another player to pass you a particular card.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Continue</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Repeat the process of selecting, activating, and passing until all players only have 2 cards left in their hands.</li>
                <li>Then, players select 1 card to keep, placing it face-down in front of them before simultaneously revealing. Players discard the card they did not choose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tip: Keep an eye on which cards your friends are placing in front of them to see what they&rsquo;re trying to collect and what you might want to pass them.</p>
            
            <h4>Targets of attacks</h4>
            <p>Players can choose to deal damage to a villain, their minions, or their trackers, reducing it by the attack amount. Damaging the villain’s trackers will often reduce the strength of their cards.</p>
            
            <h4>Character abilities</h4>
            <p>Each character has a special ability that is described on their health track. Once a player uses this ability, they cannot use it again until after the next villain turn.</p>
            
            <h3>Back into the fray!</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Keep any cards you have in front of you.</li>
            <li>Start the next round by returning to the villain phase.</li>
            <li>If a deck runs out, shuffle its discard pile to replenish.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Explaining Sets</h2>
            <p>Players collect a certain number of action cards (a set) to use them. Cards do not have effects until they are part of a set.</p>
            <p>Once a set is created, the effect on it must be activated. Sets are discarded after they are activated.</p>
            <h3>Lone hero cards</h3>
            <p>To use a lone hero card, a player must collect 3 copies of that card (1 set).</p>
            <p>Once a player has a set of lone hero cards, the solo effect is activated.</p>
            <p>If multiple lone hero cards activate at the same time, the combo effect described on the card activates instead of the solo one.</p>
            <p>Some sets have stronger solo effects while others have stronger combo effects. Make sure to pay attention to the timing of sets when considering what to play.</p>
            
            <h3>Team hero cards</h3>
            <p>To activate a team hero card&rsquo;s effect, multiple players must collect 1 or more copies of that card, depending on the specific team hero card.</p>
            <p>Team hero cards always activate <em>before</em> any Lone hero cards, and because of this, team hero cards do not cause Lone hero cards to use the combo effect. </p>
            <p>When activating a set of team hero cards, players should strike a pose.</p>
            
            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>The heroic Defense Force Ultra Squad battles otherworldly threats in secret, sheltering the citizens of Phoenix Bluff &mdash; nay, all of Earth! &mdash; from knowledge of the terrifying dangers from which they are narrowly rescued every week.</p>
            <p>The brave scouts of Defense Force Ultra Squad were once ordinary high school students. But that all changed one fateful day&hellip; That afternoon, three teens joined the Phoenix Bluff High community service club, as punishment for fighting, swelling the club&rsquo;s members to five. It was a sunny day as they tumbled into their idyllic yellow school bus and set out to pick up trash on the highway.</p>
            <p>But soon, the sky darkened. A shadow fell across the bus. Out of the sky soared a huge, fearsome monstrosity. A creature of scales and beaks, baying howls and many burning eyes, and of enormous size. It plunged right toward the bus. The students were, in a word, doomed!</p>
            <p>To their rescue &mdash; a caped figure swept in, and valiantly struck the dreadful behemoth. She fought with ferocity and amazing skill. But it was clear it was too much for her. The beast struck one more time and &mdash; she fell like a comet.</p>
            <p>The brave community service club rushed to her assistance, trash-pickers brandished like swords. The mysterious warrior rallied and together they defeated their foe.</p>
            <p>When the dust had settled, the caped hero revealed herself as an alien who had been solitarily protecting Earth. But the task was becoming too large and it was time for the world to defend itself. Impressed by the students&rsquo; bravery, she tore her mystic cape into five scarves, one for each student, and named them the planet&rsquo;s new guardians: The Defense Force Ultra Squad. When worn knotted, the scarves allow each teen to summon colorful armor of extraordinary power.</p>
            <p>The community service club advisor was too frightened by the dastardly battle, and quickly retired. Under a human name, the alien took his place, allowing her to serve as Ultra Squad scouts&rsquo; mentor. Now, while other high school students worry about prom dates and history homework, the scouts sneak out under the guise of community service trips to punch villains and learn about the power of friendship and brute force!</p>
